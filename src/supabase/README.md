# Supabase Directory

This directory previously contained backend server functions for lead management and Google Sheets integration.

As this is now a frontend-only website, the server functionality has been removed. The contact forms now display success messages locally without backend storage.

If you need to re-enable backend functionality in the future, you can:
- Set up Supabase backend integration
- Configure Google Sheets API integration
- Implement lead management and storage
